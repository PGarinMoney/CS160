\section{Introduction}
You have may seen the commercial (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afJRKbBEr2Q) in which Kevin Bacon attempts to cash a check without ID.  In this commercial Bacon collects an unlikely combination of people with increasingly tenuous relationships that somehow wind up connecting him with the owner of the store.  So you see, he says, ``we are practically related!''  This idea caught on in Hollywood and if you've acted in a movie, your Kevin Bacon number is a reflection of how many links away from Kevin Bacon you are.  One actor is linked to another if they have acted in the same movie.  For example, Simon Helberg of the Big Bang theory acted with Gillian Jacobs in \textit{Let it Go}, in 2011.  Gillian Jacobs acted with John malkovich in \textit{Gardens of the Night} in 2008.  John Malkovich acted with Kevin Bacon in \textit{Queens Logic} in 1991.

Your job is to write a program that allows the user to enter the name of an actor and then determines the Kevin Bacon number for that actor.  The program should print out the Kevin Bacon number for the actor and both the list of actors that form the chain and the movies they acted in together.

There is one data file for this assignment:  movie\_actors.csv.  The format of the file looks like this:
\vspace{.1in}


    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\textwidth}
    \begin{verbatim}
      Apokommata (2010)|Leonardo Sfontouris
      Apokommata (2010)|Dimitra Kokkori
      Apokommata (2010)|Marianna Pouloutiadou
      Apokommata (2010)|Dimitra Kokkori
      Apokommata (2010)|Anna Etiaridou
      Apokrif: Muzyka dlya Petra i Pavla (2005)|Anton Mlodik
      Apollo 13 (1995)|Bill Paxton
      Apollo 13 (1995)|Gary Sinise
      Apollo 13 (1995)|Ed Harris
      Apollo 13 (1995)|Tom Hanks
      Apollo 13 (1995)|Kevin Bacon
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{minipage}

There are three main problems to solve for this assignment:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Build a graph that represents the links between all the actors.  To build the graph you should use the Graph and Vertex classes found in the pythonds package.  These classes are implemented just like the code in the textbook.  This is the most challenging part of the assignment.  You should start with a small part of the movies\_actors file OR create your own test file. You DO NOT want to start with the full movie\_actors.csv file as it contains more than 600,000 lines.  With your test file use the Python environment to poke around at the graph and make sure that the links are correct.  You will also need to devise a way to keep track of the movie that each actor has in common with her neighbors.

    \item  Use the Breadth First Search algorithm to create the links from all actors back to Kevin Bacon.

    \item  Write a loop that allows the user to enter a name and see the Kevin Bacon number plus links.  You will need to implement the traverse function as described in the book to work backward from the actor entered to Kevin Bacon.

\end{enumerate}
Here is an example of the Kevin Bacon program in action.  Your program should produce output that is similar.
\begin{verbatim}
    host-17-15-55:python> python kevinbacon.py
    What Actor would you like to trace? (exit to quit) Johnny Galecki
    The Kevin Bacon Number for  Johnny Galecki  is  3
    Johnny Galecki acted with Rachael Leigh Cook in Bookies (2003)
    Rachael Leigh Cook acted with Luke Wilson in Blonde Ambition (2007)
    Luke Wilson acted with Kevin Bacon in My Dog Skip (2000)

    What Actor would you like to trace? (exit to quit)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Grading}
This program is due Friday May 13 at 5:00pm.

There are 30 points to this assignment:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15 points for correctly building and searching the graph
\item 10 points for traversing the searched graph
\item 5 points for good programming practice and style
\end{itemize}
