# Make a binary tree where the value of the root node is the priority
# Modify insert left/right to accept a BinaryTree rather than make one.

# The simplest construction algorithm uses a priority queue where the node with lowest probability is given highest priority:

# Create a leaf node for each symbol and add it to the priority queue.
# While there is more than one node in the queue:
# Remove the two nodes of highest priority (lowest probability) from the queue
# Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with probability equal to the sum of the two nodes' probabilities.
# Add the new node to the queue.
# The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.
# Since efficient priority queue data structures require O(log n) time per insertion, and a tree with n leaves has 2nâˆ’1 nodes, this algorithm operates in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of symbols.
