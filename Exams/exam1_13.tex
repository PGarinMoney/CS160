% Questions start here:
\begin{questions}

% \question Suppose you are writing an application to keep the payroll for some company.  Your application consists of \textit{at least} three classes:  \texttt{Person}, \texttt{Manager}, and \texttt{Worker}.  A \texttt{Person}  has a name and year of birth.  A \texttt{Worker} has a department and a monthly salary. A \texttt{Manager} has a department and a salary and a bonus equal to 10\% of their salary.  Hint:  Sometimes it can make your life easier if you introduce an ``extra'' class into your hierarchy to accomodate two classes that are similar.

% \begin{parts}
% 	\part[10] Implement the classes of your inheritance hierarchy.  In particular you should write an efficient constructor for each class, and an \verb~__str__~ method for each class, and a \texttt{compensation} method that returns the total yearly compensation.

\question[5] Convert the following expression to its Postfix form.  You do not need to demonstrate the algorithm, just write the final form.
$$A~*~B~+~C~/~D$$
\vspace{1.5in}

\question[5] Show how the stack is used in evaluating the following postfix expression.  Make sure you show the stack at enough stages to convince me that you understand the algorithm.
$$7~13~*~12~8~-~4~+~10~*~+$$

\question[5] Rank the following functions in order from slowest
growing to fastest.
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$
\item $N log(N)$
\item $1$
\item $log(N)$
\item $N^2$
\end{itemize}

\question[5] Give the Big-O limits for the following Python operations.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{list.insert(0)}
\item \texttt{dict[key] = value}
\item \texttt{list.pop()}
\item \texttt{dict[x] = 5}
\item \texttt{list.append()}
\end{itemize}

\question[10] For this question you must implement a \texttt{Queue} class.  However you may \textbf{not} use a Python list in your implementation.  You \textbf{must} use The \textit{Node}  class shown below.   Implement the methods \verb!__init__!, \texttt{enqueue}, \texttt{dequeu}, and \texttt{isempty}.
\begin{verbatim}
	class Node:
    def __init__(self,initdata):
        self.data = initdata
        self.next = None

    def getData(self):
        return self.data

    def getNext(self):
        return self.next

    def setData(self,newdata):
        self.data = newdata

    def setNext(self,newnext):
        self.next = newnext
\end{verbatim}

%Given a singly linked list, how could the list be printed in reverse order in O(n)?


\question Using the following code fragment:
\begin{lstlisting}
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
         sum = sum + 1
for p in range(0,n*n):
   for q in range(n):
      sum = sum - 1
for s in range(20):
   for t in range(5):
      sum = sum + 1
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{parts}
  \part[3] Using Big-O notation, What is the worst case performance
   for the set of loops in lines 2--4?
   \vspace{0.5in}
  \part[3] Using Big-O notation, What is the worst case performance
   for the set of loops in lines 5--7?
   \vspace{0.5in}
  \part[3] Using Big-O notation, What is the worst case performance
   for the set of loops in lines 8--10?
   \vspace{0.5in}
  \part[3] Using Big-O notation, What is the overall worst case performance?
   \vspace{0.5in}
\end{parts}
\emph{Hint:}  Make sure you pay close attention to the arguments to range.


\newpage
\question[10] For this question you must implement a \texttt{Stack} class.  However you may \textbf{not} use a list in your implementation.  You \textbf{must} use two \texttt{Queues}.  Implement the methods \verb!__init__!, \texttt{push}, \texttt{pop}, and \texttt{isempty}.
